# playcanvas-external-versioning
Repository will be linked to the versioning system of PlayCanvas

## Update
Linking repositories is only possible in PlayCanvas projects, which are using the legacy system. The recently introduced versioning system in PlayCanvas does not allow linking with external repositories (~january 2019). Neither with a personal account nor with a private or an organization account! For that reason I will put this repository on hold.
