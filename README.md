Repository will be linked to the versioning system of PlayCanvas

## Update
With a public account it looks like as I would not have the ability to link my Github repos with my PlayCanvas projects.
Somehow it makes sense to me, but I have to double-check that with an organization account.
I could swear, that I saw the code dashboard again lately.
Maybe one of my colleagues activated the legacy system for a project, where the dashboard was available.
But hopefully it is back again, perhaps as an exclusive feature for private and organization accounts.
